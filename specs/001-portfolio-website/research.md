# Research Summary: Portfolio Website

## Decision: Technology Stack Selection
**Rationale**: Based on the feature requirements and user input, Angular 20+ with Bootstrap 5.3+ provides the optimal combination for building an accessible, responsive portfolio website that matches the Massively template aesthetic. Angular provides a robust component-based architecture with excellent accessibility features, while Bootstrap ensures consistent styling and responsive design.

**Alternatives considered**: 
- React + Bootstrap: Popular but would require additional state management solutions
- Vue + Tailwind: Good option but less enterprise adoption than Angular
- Pure HTML/CSS/JS: Would lack the accessibility and maintainability features needed

## Decision: WCAG 2.1 AA Compliance Implementation
**Rationale**: Using Angular's built-in accessibility features, ARIA attributes, semantic HTML, and proper color contrast ratios will ensure compliance with WCAG 2.1 AA standards. Angular has strong built-in accessibility infrastructure that makes compliance more achievable.

**Alternatives considered**:
- Manual implementation: Risky without proper tooling
- Third-party accessibility libraries: Would add unnecessary complexity

## Decision: Cross-Browser Compatibility Strategy
**Rationale**: Using Angular CLI's built-in browser support configuration with polyfills and modern CSS reset will ensure compatibility. Testing with BrowserStack or similar services will validate functionality across browsers.

**Alternatives considered**:
- Feature detection libraries: Unnecessary for a portfolio site
- Separate browser-specific code paths: Would add maintenance overhead

## Decision: Massively Template Adaptation Approach
**Rationale**: Converting the HTML5 UP Massively template to Angular components while maintaining its visual aesthetic through CSS and layout. We'll preserve the original CSS variables, typography, and spacing while adapting to Angular's component architecture.

**Alternatives considered**:
- Building from scratch: Would not meet the aesthetic preservation requirement
- Using a different template: Would not meet the requirement to maintain Massively's aesthetic

## Decision: Content Management with Markdown Files
**Rationale**: Using Angular to parse Markdown files with YAML frontmatter through a custom service. This provides the content management flexibility while keeping the site static and efficient.

**Alternatives considered**:
- Static site generators: Would require different architecture
- Headless CMS: Would add complexity and dependencies

## Decision: Accessibility Implementation Strategy
**Rationale**: Implementing keyboard navigation, ARIA attributes, semantic HTML structure, proper focus management, and color contrast ratios to meet WCAG 2.1 AA standards. Angular's accessibility tools and best practices will guide the implementation.

**Alternatives considered**:
- Partial compliance: Would not meet the requirement
- Manual accessibility testing only: Would be insufficient for full compliance

## Decision: Testing Strategy
**Rationale**: Using Angular's testing frameworks (Jasmine/Karma for unit tests, Cypress for e2e tests) with accessibility testing tools like axe-core and cross-browser testing with automated tools and manual validation.

**Alternatives considered**:
- Manual testing only: Insufficient for reliable compliance
- Different testing frameworks: Would add unnecessary complexity
