# Research Summary: Portfolio Website Implementation

## Decision: Technology Stack Selection - Angular 20+, CSS, and Bootstrap 5.3+
**Rationale**: The selection of Angular 20+, CSS, and Bootstrap 5.3+ is based on the specific requirements for creating a modern, accessible, and responsive portfolio website that maintains the aesthetic of HTML5 UP's Massively template. Angular provides a robust component-based architecture with excellent accessibility features, TypeScript support, and enterprise-grade tooling that is well-suited for maintaining a portfolio site with structured content. Bootstrap 5.3+ provides a comprehensive CSS framework with responsive utilities, pre-built components, and utility classes that will facilitate the recreation of the Massively template's visual design while ensuring cross-browser compatibility. Modern CSS features like Grid, Flexbox, and custom properties will enhance the styling capabilities while maintaining maintainability.

**Alternatives considered**:
- React + Bootstrap: While popular, React has a different component model and ecosystem
- Vue + Tailwind: Good option but lacks the comprehensive tooling ecosystem of Angular CLI
- Pure HTML/CSS/JS: Would lack the maintainability, accessibility features, and component architecture necessary for an accessible portfolio site
- Angular with Material Design: Would not preserve the Massively template aesthetic which requires Bootstrap styling

## Decision: WCAG 2.1 AA Compliance Implementation Strategy
**Rationale**: To ensure full WCAG 2.1 AA compliance, the implementation will leverage Angular's built-in accessibility features including ARIA attributes, semantic HTML elements, keyboard navigation patterns, and focus management. We'll implement skip navigation links, proper heading hierarchy (H1 to H6), sufficient color contrast ratios (minimum 4.5:1 for normal text, 3:1 for large text), ARIA landmarks, and programmatic access to all functionality. The accessibility service will provide utility functions for managing focus, high contrast mode, and screen reader announcements.

**Alternatives considered**:
- Manual implementation without framework utilities: High risk of missing compliance elements
- Third-party accessibility libraries: Would add unnecessary complexity when Angular provides comprehensive accessibility tools
- WCAG 2.0 compliance: WCAG 2.1 is the current standard and provides better guidelines for modern web applications

## Decision: Cross-Browser Compatibility Strategy
**Rationale**: Using Angular CLI's built-in browser support configuration with polyfills for legacy browser support, along with Bootstrap's extensive cross-browser compatibility. We'll configure browserslist in package.json to support Chrome 90+, Firefox 88+, Safari 15+, Edge 90+ as specified in the constitution. Additionally, we'll implement feature detection rather than browser detection, use autoprefixer for CSS vendor prefixes, and test with BrowserStack or similar services to validate functionality across browsers.

**Alternatives considered**:
- Feature detection libraries: Unnecessary complexity for a portfolio site with known target browsers
- Separate browser-specific code paths: Would add significant maintenance overhead
- Supporting older browsers: Would compromise performance and modern web features

## Decision: Massively Template Adaptation Approach
**Rationale**: Converting the HTML5 UP Massively template to Angular components while maintaining its visual aesthetic through CSS and layout preservation. We'll extract the key CSS variables, typography styles, spacing, and visual elements from the original template, converting them to Angular component styles with Bootstrap integration where appropriate. The approach will use Angular's component architecture to break down the template into reusable components while preserving the immersive background, typography, and overall design language that makes the Massively template distinctive.

**Alternatives considered**:
- Building from scratch: Would not meet the aesthetic preservation requirement
- Using a different template: Would not meet the requirement to maintain Massively's aesthetic

## Decision: Content Management with Markdown Files and YAML Frontmatter
**Rationale**: Utilizing Angular services to parse Markdown files with YAML frontmatter through Angular's HttpClient and a Markdown parser library like marked.js or Angular's own DomSanitizer for security. This provides content management flexibility while maintaining the static site deployment approach specified in the requirements. The approach allows for structured metadata in the YAML frontmatter while preserving rich text formatting in the Markdown body, meeting both the technical and content management requirements.

**Alternatives considered**:
- Static site generators: Would require different architecture and tooling
- Headless CMS: Would add complexity and dependencies not needed for a personal portfolio
- JSON files only: Would not provide the rich text formatting capabilities of Markdown
- Database-driven content: Not appropriate for a static portfolio site

## Decision: Component Architecture Following Angular 20+ Standards
**Rationale**: Implementing a component-first architecture using Angular's standalone components pattern (new in Angular 15+ and mature in Angular 20+), with each major section (hero, gallery, about, contact) as a standalone component. Each component will follow Angular style guide patterns with OnPush change detection strategy where possible, proper input/output patterns for loose coupling, and clear separation of presentation and business logic through services. Component styling will follow Angular's encapsulation patterns with SCSS for component-specific styles.

**Alternatives considered**:
- Traditional module-based architecture: More complex than needed for this use case
- Monolithic components: Would violate the component-first architecture principle

## Decision: Testing Strategy for Compliance and Compatibility
**Rationale**: Implementing a comprehensive testing strategy using Angular's testing frameworks (Jasmine/Karma for unit tests, Angular Testing Library for component tests) with accessibility testing tools like axe-core, cross-browser testing with automated tools, and manual validation. Unit tests will verify component functionality, accessibility tests will validate WCAG 2.1 AA compliance, and e2e tests with Cypress will validate user journeys and cross-browser compatibility.

**Alternatives considered**:
- Manual testing only: Insufficient for reliable compliance and compatibility validation
- Different testing frameworks: Angular's integrated testing tools provide the best integration and reliability

## Decision: CSS Integration Approach with Bootstrap 5.3+ and Angular
**Rationale**: Implementing CSS styles using SCSS with Angular's component encapsulation to maintain local styling while integrating with Bootstrap 5.3+ global styles. We'll use Bootstrap's utility classes for consistent spacing and responsive behavior while customizing the Massively template aesthetic through component-specific SCSS files. Modern CSS features like Grid, Flexbox, and custom properties will be utilized for maintainable, scalable styling that integrates seamlessly with Bootstrap's utility-first approach.

**Alternatives considered**:
- CSS-in-JS: Would not align with Angular's styling patterns
- Global CSS only: Would make components less reusable and increase style conflicts
- Pure Bootstrap classes: Would not maintain the specific Massively template aesthetic

## Decision: Performance Optimization Strategy
**Rationale**: Implement performance optimization through Angular's built-in features like lazy loading, tree-shaking of unused Bootstrap CSS, image optimization with WebP formats where supported, and proper bundle optimization. Implement first meaningful paint optimization by prioritizing critical CSS and content, and optimize time to interactive by minimizing JavaScript payload and optimizing resource loading.

**Alternatives considered**:
- Basic optimization only: Would not meet the 3s FMP and 5s TTI requirements
- Server-side rendering: Unnecessary complexity for a static portfolio site
