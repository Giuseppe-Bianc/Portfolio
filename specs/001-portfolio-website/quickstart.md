# Quickstart Guide: Portfolio Website Implementation

## Prerequisites

### System Requirements
- Node.js (v18.13.0 or later) with npm v9.0.0+ for package management and build processes
- Angular CLI (v20.3.6 or later) for project scaffolding, development server, and production builds
- Git (v2.20.0 or later) for version control and collaboration workflows
- Modern web browser (Chrome 90+, Firefox 88+, Safari 15+, Edge 90+) for development and testing
- Text editor or IDE with TypeScript and SCSS support (VS Code recommended with Angular extension pack)

### Development Environment Setup
Before beginning the implementation, ensure your development environment meets the prerequisites. The portfolio website requires specific versions of tools to maintain compatibility with Angular 20+, Bootstrap 5.3+, and modern CSS features. Verify your Node.js version with `node --version` and install the latest LTS version if needed from nodejs.org.

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Initialize Angular Project
Begin by creating a new Angular project with the required specifications:
```bash
# Create new Angular project with routing and SCSS styling
ng new portfolio-website --routing=true --style=scss --standalone=true

# Navigate to project directory
cd portfolio-website
```

The `--standalone=true` flag ensures the project follows Angular's latest component architecture pattern, which aligns with our component-first architecture principle from the constitution.

### 2. Install Bootstrap and Dependencies
Install Bootstrap 5.3+ and other necessary dependencies for the portfolio website:
```bash
# Install Bootstrap 5.3+ and its required dependencies
npm install bootstrap@^5.3.8

# Install additional dependencies for content processing and accessibility
npm install marked@^12.0.0 dompurify@^3.0.0
npm install --save-dev @types/marked@^5.0.0
```

### 3. Configure Bootstrap and CSS in Angular
Add Bootstrap CSS and JavaScript to your `angular.json` file under the project's build options:

```json
{
  "projects": {
    "portfolio-website": {
      "architect": {
        "build": {
          "builder": "@angular/build:application",
          "options": {
            "styles": [
              "node_modules/bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css",
              "src/styles.scss"
            ],
            "scripts": [
              "node_modules/bootstrap/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js"
            ]
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Alternatively, you can import Bootstrap in your `src/styles.scss` file:
```scss
// Import Bootstrap SCSS files for customization capability
@import 'bootstrap/scss/bootstrap';
```

### 4. Configure TypeScript and Compilation Settings
Update your `tsconfig.json` to include strict type checking and ensure compatibility with Angular 20+ standards:

```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "strict": true,
    "noImplicitOverride": true,
    "noPropertyAccessFromIndexSignature": true,
    "noImplicitReturns": true,
    "noFallthroughCasesInSwitch": true,
    "skipLibCheck": true,
    "isolatedModules": true,
    "moduleResolution": "bundler",
    "experimentalDecorators": true,
    "importHelpers": true,
    "target": "ES2022",
    "module": "ES2022"
  },
  "angularCompilerOptions": {
    "enableI18nLegacyMessageIdFormat": false,
    "strictInjectionParameters": true,
    "strictInputAccessModifiers": true,
    "strictTemplates": true
  }
}
```

### 5. Configure CSS/SCSS Linting
Set up stylelint for consistent CSS/SCSS formatting as required by the constitution:

```bash
# Install stylelint for CSS/SCSS validation
npm install --save-dev stylelint stylelint-config-standard-scss
```

Create a `.stylelintrc.json` file:
```json
{
  "extends": [
    "stylelint-config-standard-scss"
  ],
  "rules": {
    "indentation": 2,
    "string-quotes": "single",
    "color-hex-case": "lower",
    "color-hex-length": "short",
    "selector-max-id": 0,
    "no-duplicate-selectors": true,
    "no-descending-specificity": null
  }
}
```

## Development Workflow

### 1. Start Development Server
Launch the Angular development server to begin implementing the portfolio:
```bash
# Start development server with live reload
ng serve

# The application will be available at http://localhost:4200
# Changes to source files will automatically reload the browser
```

### 2. Create Project Structure Based on Massively Template
Implement the core components of the Massively template by creating the following component structure:

```bash
# Generate core components based on user stories
ng generate component components/hero
ng generate component components/project-gallery
ng generate component components/navigation
ng generate component components/about
ng generate component components/contact
ng generate component components/shared/project-card
```

### 3. Add Content Management Structure
Create the content directory structure for Markdown-based content management:
```bash
# Create content directories in src/assets
mkdir -p src/assets/content/projects
mkdir -p src/assets/content/pages
mkdir -p src/assets/images
mkdir -p src/assets/styles
```

### 4. Add New Project Content
To add a new project to your portfolio:

1. Create a new Markdown file in `src/assets/content/projects/`
2. Follow the structure with YAML frontmatter:

```yaml
---
title: "Project Name"
date: "2025-01-15"
slug: "project-name"
technologies:
  - "Angular"
  - "TypeScript"
  - "Bootstrap"
images:
  - "/assets/images/project-name-thumb.webp"
  - "/assets/images/project-name-full.jpg"
links:
  github: "https://github.com/username/project"
  demo: "https://project-demo.com"
featured: true
---
# Project Details

Detailed description of the project in Markdown format with support for headings, lists, code blocks, and emphasis formatting. The content is processed through a sanitization pipeline to prevent XSS vulnerabilities while preserving the rich text formatting capabilities that Markdown provides.
```

### 5. Update Developer Profile
Edit the profile information in `src/assets/content/profile.json`:

```json
{
  "name": "Your Name",
  "title": "Your Title",
  "bio": "A comprehensive biographical description that establishes professional credentials while maintaining concise presentation to optimize user attention.",
  "skills": ["JavaScript", "TypeScript", "Angular", "React", "Node.js"],
  "experience": "Professional experience details in Markdown format, allowing for structured presentation of career history, major accomplishments, and professional achievements.",
  "contactInfo": {
    "email": "your-email@example.com",
    "phone": "+1-555-123-4567",
    "socialLinks": {
      "github": "https://github.com/your-profile",
      "linkedin": "https://linkedin.com/in/your-profile",
      "twitter": "https://twitter.com/your-profile"
    }
  }
}
```

## Testing

### Unit Testing
Run unit tests using Angular's built-in testing framework:
```bash
# Run unit tests once
ng test

# Run unit tests in watch mode for continuous testing during development
ng test --watch=true
```

Unit tests should achieve â‰¥90% coverage as specified in the constitution, with particular attention to component logic, service functionality, and content processing.

### Accessibility Testing
Validate accessibility compliance with automated tools:
```bash
# Install accessibility testing tools
npm install --save-dev @axe-core/cli

# Run accessibility tests on the built application
npx axe-cli http://localhost:4200 --include "body" --show-errors

# Or integrate with your existing e2e tests using axe-core
npm install --save-dev @axe-core/puppeteer
```

### End-to-End Testing
Set up and run e2e tests using Cypress or Angular's E2E framework:
```bash
# Add e2e testing framework
ng add @cypress/schematic

# Run e2e tests
ng e2e

# Run e2e tests in interactive mode for development
ng e2e --watch
```

### Cross-Browser Compatibility Testing
Validate functionality across target browsers:
```bash
# Use browserslist configuration in package.json to specify target browsers
# Chrome 90+, Firefox 88+, Safari 15+, Edge 90+

# For manual testing, use browser vendor tools:
# - Chrome DevTools Device Mode for mobile testing
# - Firefox Responsive Design Mode
# - Safari Device Simulation
# - Edge Developer Tools
```

### CSS/SCSS Validation
Validate CSS/SCSS formatting and best practices:
```bash
# Run stylelint to validate CSS/SCSS formatting
npx stylelint "src/**/*.scss"

# Run stylelint with auto-fix
npx stylelint "src/**/*.scss" --fix
```

## Build for Production

### Standard Production Build
Create a production-ready build with optimization:
```bash
# Build for production with optimization
ng build --configuration production

# Output will be in the dist/ folder, ready for deployment
```

### Performance Optimization Build
Build with additional performance analytics:
```bash
# Build with bundle analysis to identify optimization opportunities
ng build --configuration production --stats-json

# Analyze the generated stats.json file with tools like webpack-bundle-analyzer
npx webpack-bundle-analyzer dist/portfolio-website/browser/stats.json
```

## Deployment

### Deploy to Netlify
1. Build the project: `ng build --configuration production`
2. The `dist/` folder contains the static files ready for deployment
3. Connect to Netlify through their UI or CLI:
```bash
# Install Netlify CLI
npm install -g netlify-cli

# Login to Netlify
netlify login

# Deploy the built application
netlify deploy --dir=dist/portfolio-website/browser --prod
```
