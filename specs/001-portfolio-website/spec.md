**Feature Branch**: `001-portfolio-website`  
**Created**: 23-10-2025  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "crea un portfolio website like https://html5up.net/massively"

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Homepage with Hero Section (Priority: P1)

As a visitor, I want to land on a visually compelling portfolio homepage that showcases the developer's work and identity in an elegant, immersive way, so that I can quickly understand who they are and what they do.

**Why this priority**: This is the entry point that creates the first impression and sets the tone for the entire portfolio experience. It's the most critical element in making visitors stay and explore more content.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by visiting the homepage and verifying the hero section displays properly with background image, title, and navigation. Delivers the core value of presenting the developer's identity and work effectively.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** I am a visitor to the portfolio website, **When** I land on the homepage, **Then** I see an immersive hero section with a background image, title, and clear navigation to other sections
2. **Given** I am viewing the homepage on a mobile device, **When** I scroll down, **Then** the hero section transforms appropriately to maintain visual appeal and readability

### User Story 2 - Project Showcase Gallery (Priority: P1)

As a visitor, I want to browse through a gallery of projects that showcases the developer's skills and completed work with sufficient detail to evaluate their expertise, so that I can decide if they're the right fit for my needs.

**Why this priority**: The core value of a portfolio is demonstrating actual work. Without a project showcase, the portfolio fails to deliver its primary purpose.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by browsing the project gallery and viewing project details. Delivers the value of showing concrete examples of the developer's work.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** I am viewing the portfolio, **When** I navigate to the projects section, **Then** I see a well-organized gallery of projects with thumbnails, titles, brief descriptions, and technologies used

### User Story 3 - Responsive Navigation and Sections (Priority: P2)

As a visitor, I want to easily navigate between different sections of the portfolio (about, projects, contact) on any device, so that I can access the information I need regardless of how I'm accessing the site.

**Why this priority**: Without proper navigation, users cannot access the portfolio's content effectively, making the entire portfolio useless regardless of how good the content is.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by navigating between sections on different devices and verifying all content is accessible. Delivers the value of making the portfolio usable across all platforms.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** I am on a desktop computer, **When** I click navigation links, **Then** I can seamlessly move between portfolio sections
2. **Given** I am on a mobile device, **When** I open the navigation menu, **Then** I can clearly see and select different sections of the portfolio

### User Story 4 - About Section with Personal Information (Priority: P2)

As a visitor, I want to learn about the developer's background, skills, and experience in the about section, so that I can understand their qualifications and professional journey.

**Why this priority**: This provides essential context about the developer's expertise and background, which is important for establishing credibility and trust with potential clients or employers.

### User Story 5 - Contact Information and Form (Priority: P3)

As a visitor, I want to be able to contact the developer through various methods, so I can reach out for potential job opportunities or collaborations.

**Why this priority**: This enables business opportunities and connections, which is a key goal of any portfolio site, though secondary to showcasing the work itself.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by viewing contact information and attempting to use contact methods. Delivers the value of enabling communication between visitors and the developer.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** I am interested in contacting the developer, **When** I navigate to the contact section, **Then** I see multiple contact methods including email and social links
2. **Given** I want to send a message, **When** I click the contact link, **Then** my email client opens with a pre-filled message to the developer

### Edge Cases

- What happens when a project image fails to load? The site should display a fallback image or placeholder
- How does the system handle users with JavaScript disabled? The site should still be navigable and functional
- What if a visitor has slow internet connection? The site should provide a good experience even with images loading slowly

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: System MUST display an immersive homepage with a large background image and title text that creates an elegant, engaging first impression
- **FR-002**: System MUST provide a responsive navigation system that works on mobile, tablet, and desktop devices
- **FR-003**: System MUST showcase portfolio projects in an organized gallery or grid format with thumbnail images, title, brief description, and technologies used
- **FR-004**: System MUST provide links to external resources (GitHub, live demos) for full project details
- **FR-005**: System MUST include an "About" section with personal information, skills, and professional background
- **FR-006**: System MUST include a contact section with contact information and methods including a mailto: link
- **FR-007**: System MUST be responsive and adapt to different screen sizes (desktop, tablet, mobile)
- **FR-008**: System MUST be accessible and comply with WCAG 2.1 AA standards
- **FR-009**: System MUST load efficiently and provide good performance across devices
- **FR-012**: System MUST implement basic observability: include analytics (Google Analytics or Matomo), uptime/synthetic checks (via hosting provider or service like StatusCake), and simple RUM/performance scripts to capture key metrics (First Contentful Paint, Time to Interactive). Acceptance: uptime >= 99.9% (monthly), synthetic check frequency 15 minutes, and collection of RUM metrics for at least 5% of sessions for performance analysis.
- **FR-013**: Content MUST be stored in structured data files (JSON, YAML, or Markdown) that feed into templates for easy updates
- **FR-014**: System MUST handle failed project assets (images, thumbnails, external embeds) with graceful degradation: display a descriptive placeholder image, attempt one automatic reload, preserve layout (no content shift), provide appropriate alt text, and emit an error event to observability. Acceptance: placeholder shown within 500ms of load failure, retry attempted once within 2 seconds, and error event recorded for observability.
- **FR-015**: Content MUST be stored as Markdown files with YAML frontmatter that feed into templates for easy updates. Project content SHOULD live under `content/projects/*.md`. Required frontmatter fields for a `Portfolio Project` include: `title` (string), `date` (YYYY-MM-DD), `slug` (string), `technologies` (array of strings), `images` (array of image paths), `links` (object with `github` and `demo` URLs), `featured` (boolean). The markdown body is used for the long project description. This format balances structured metadata and rich text for project details.
- **FR-016**: System MUST include social media links for professional networking platforms

- **FR-017**: System SHOULD be deployed to Netlify (recommended) or an equivalent static hosting provider with global CDN. Deployment must provide atomic deploys, deploy previews for pull requests, support for custom redirects, and easy integration for uptime/synthetic checks and RUM scripts. Acceptance: deploy previews enabled, CDN cache headers configurable, and synthetic checks integrated within hosting or monitoring setup.

### Key Entities

- **Portfolio Project**: A work sample that includes title, description, technologies used, images, and links to live demos or source code
- **Developer Profile**: Information about the developer including bio, skills, experience, and contact information
- **Contact Method**: Ways for visitors to reach out to the developer (email, social media links, contact form)

### Assumptions

- The portfolio will be hosted on a static web hosting service (e.g., GitHub Pages, Netlify)
- Project images will be pre-optimized for web delivery
- Contact will be handled through a simple mailto: link that opens the user's email client
- Content will be stored in structured data files (JSON, YAML, or Markdown) that feed into templates

## Clarifications
