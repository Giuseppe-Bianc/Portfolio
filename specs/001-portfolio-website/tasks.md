# Tasks: Portfolio Website

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/001-portfolio-website/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md (required), spec.md (required for user stories), research.md, data-model.md, contracts/

**Tests (MANDATORY - TDD)**: Tests are included as specified in the feature requirements and are MANDATORY per the project constitution. All tests (unit, accessibility, integration, e2e) must be written first and fail before implementation (Red). Implementation proceeds only after creating tests that initially fail, then making them pass (Red-Green-Refactor).
CI MUST enforce test execution and coverage thresholds (see tasks T082-T084 added below).

**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by user story to enable independent implementation and testing of each story.

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description`

- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to (e.g., US1, US2, US3)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Path Conventions

- **Single project**: `src/`, `tests/` at repository root
- Paths shown below based on the Angular project structure defined in plan.md

## Phase 1: Setup (Shared Infrastructure)

**Purpose**: Project initialization and basic structure

- [ ] T001 Create Angular project structure with TypeScript 5.9 and Angular 20.3+
- [ ] T002 Install Bootstrap 5.3+ and configure in angular.json
- [ ] T003 [P] Configure linting and formatting tools (ESLint, Prettier)
- [ ] T004 Create initial directory structure per plan.md specification
- [ ] T005 [P] Install development dependencies (Jasmine/Karma, Cypress, axe-core)
- [ ] T006 Setup environment configuration files

---

## Phase 2: Foundational (Blocking Prerequisites)

**Purpose**: Core infrastructure that MUST be complete before ANY user story can be implemented

**⚠️ CRITICAL**: No user story work can begin until this phase is complete

- [ ] T007 Create base models per data-model.md: project.model.ts, developer-profile.model.ts, contact.model.ts
- [ ] T008 [P] Create content service to handle markdown/json file loading

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - can start immediately
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup completion - BLOCKS all user stories
- **User Stories (Phase 3+)**: All depend on Foundational phase completion
  - User stories can then proceed in parallel (if staffed)
  - Or sequentially in priority order (P1 → P2 → P3)
- **Polish (Final Phase)**: Depends on all desired user stories being complete

### User Story Dependencies

- **User Story 1 (P1)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - No dependencies on other stories
- **User Story 2 (P2)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - No dependencies on other stories
- **User Story 3 (P3)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - May integrate with other stories but is independently testable
- **User Story 4 (P4)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - No dependencies on other stories
- **User Story 5 (P5)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - No dependencies on other stories

### Within Each User Story

- Tests (if included) MUST be written and FAIL before implementation
- Models before services
- Services before components
- Core implementation before integration
- Story complete before moving to next priority

### Parallel Opportunities

- All Setup tasks marked [P] can run in parallel
- All Foundational tasks marked [P] can run in parallel (within Phase 2)
- Once Foundational phase completes, all user stories can start in parallel (if team capacity allows)
- All tests for a user story marked [P] can run in parallel
- Components within a story marked [P] can run in parallel
- Different user stories can be worked on in parallel by different team members

---

## Parallel Example: User Story 1

```bash
# Launch all component files for User Story 1 together:
Task: "Create hero component structure in src/app/components/hero/hero.component.ts"
Task: "Create hero component template in src/app/components/hero/hero.component.html"
Task: "Create hero component styles in src/app/components/hero/hero.component.css"
```

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First (User Story 1 Only)

1. Complete Phase 1: Setup
2. Complete Phase 2: Foundational (CRITICAL - blocks all stories)
3. Complete Phase 3: User Story 1
4. **STOP and VALIDATE**: Test User Story 1 independently
5. Deploy/demo if ready

### Incremental Delivery

1. Complete Setup + Foundational → Foundation ready
2. Add User Story 1 → Test independently → Deploy/Demo (MVP!)
3. Add User Story 2 → Test independently → Deploy/Demo
4. Add User Story 3 → Test independently → Deploy/Demo
5. Add User Story 4 → Test independently → Deploy/Demo
6. Add User Story 5 → Test independently → Deploy/Demo
7. Each story adds value without breaking previous stories

### Parallel Team Strategy

With multiple developers:

1. Team completes Setup + Foundational together
2. Once Foundational is done:
   - Developer A: User Story 1
   - Developer B: User Story 2
   - Developer C: User Story 3
   - Developer D: User Story 4
   - Developer E: User Story 5
3. Stories complete and integrate independently

## Notes

- [P] tasks = different files, no dependencies
- [Story] label maps task to specific user story for traceability
- Each user story should be independently completable and testable
- Verify tests fail before implementing
- Commit after each task or logical group
- Stop at any checkpoint to validate story independently
- Avoid: vague tasks, same file conflicts, cross-story dependencies that break independence
